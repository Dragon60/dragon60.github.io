By far one of the best phones that Samsung released maybe in general. Longer lasting battery with a 4000-mAh battery. Better of storge than any other phone, 128GB to 512GB+ since you can add a mico SD card. Average size screen 6.4in. Softwear is android which is a good platform to use.

> price is close to 1 thousand dollars 

# pros
Having a good or decent ram with a 6/8 GB. Most noticble is the new S-Pen. With having big hands it better to have a pen to write with. 

# cons
Its similar to the the note 8 and 8+ which they should come up with a new model. It expencive to most people.

# Why I recommend this product 
This is mostly for gamers since the company says that is the best phone to game with since the new cooling system the added in is really high tech which speaks for its self. Have the right fit for any hand and it haves aspects of other phones such as the edge 6-9. best Graphic of the phone indistery.
