## Tesla Roadster 2020

0-60 in 1.9 seconds stocked, 0ne of the best car to have in the future if you like going fast or don’t like using cars that run on gas or engines. This car is going to change a lots of lives since most people such as myself loves tesla cars since they don’t use gas and sometimes faster than cars that use gas. In one charge the Roadster can go 620 miles and the funny thing is they tested it as a prototype car/ stocked which is more impressive than other cars.

## 2020 Porsche Taycan 

If you like the Porsche series then you are going to love the new car they are going to release and that is the Taycan 2020. There is not a lot of information about this car but we at least know that it is going to be affordable the rough estimate is 75,000 and the down payment is 2,500 which to me is a reasonable price to pay. The one reason I included this car in this blog is that it’s going to be the first car of Porsches series to be an electric car.

## 2020 Alfa Romeo GTV

It’s a series of luxury cars and also going fast with having a six hundred horsepower engine. Even though the GTV is similar to the Giulia the interior set up is a lot better. 0-60 in 3.9 seconds which is pretty amazing but its top speed is 190. If you like hybrid then this is a right car for you since it does have ecoboost which help out the speed of the car.
