##Friday the 13th series

Jason is one of the most iconic horror film series in the world since the legendary hockey mask was introduced in part 3 and that gave him a new look instead of the sack that was on top of his head. You got to love his iconic weapon of killing and that is the machete. Racking up so many different ways seeing him such as in Friday the 13th Jason Takes Manhattan we see a guy in a mask and that’s all I can say since he really doesn’t look like a fearsome killer. 

## Problems of the series 

Even though I believe that the reboot of the Friday the 13th was the best movie out of all the movies, it did do horrible in the box office since it only earned 91 million but 40.6million came from the opening week which is kind of bad in a sense [here](http://www.digitalspy.com/movies/feature/a869238/friday-the-13th-movies-reboot-release-date-cast-trailer-plot/).. But what makes it iconic for jason was that instead of him killing with his bear hands he would use traps such as bear traps, a fire trap, and him throwing an axe at someone which is new for him which changes his personality in other eyes.

> The reboot was still the best
