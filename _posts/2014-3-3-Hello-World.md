![Is social media Good or bad for kids?](/images/accounts-applications-apps-267350.jpg)

Kids mostly say that they have it for they can talk to their friends a lot faster. Which doesn’t make sense since they have their friends at school. Or why cant they use good old phone text messaging or even calling when they are not at school. Social media killed most of the experience of texting since now you can send a photo with a text message inside the photo and that’s called texting which is pointless.
